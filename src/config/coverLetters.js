The advances of computer-aided design tools used to create realistic digital composite drawings make hand sketches seem like relics of a bygone era. While I embrace technology, I also believe that hand-drawn sketches can be just as effective in capturing the nuances of facial characteristics. \n\nThe forensic artist opening advertised on Monster marries old-school drawing with modern technology, and I am very interested in joining your team. As part of my associate’s degree in fine art program that I completed last year, I worked as a police composite artist apprentice for XYZ Police Department in Sometown, NY. In this role, I sketched accurate facial likenesses and created digital age progressions using Photoshop to help find missing persons and identify criminal suspects. \n\nThroughout the apprenticeship, I was commended for my ability to build rapport with witnesses, crime victims, family members and law enforcement officers to help solve active and cold cases. I developed skills in forensic-imaging techniques, portraiture and facial-change characteristics. \n\nABC Agency’s mission to rescue and recover missing and exploited children is one that I share, and I believe I can make significant contributions as a member of your team. You can reach me at 555-555-5555 or email gc@somedomain.com. Thank you for your time. \n\nSincerely, \nGeorge Cole \n\nEnclosures: Résumé and Work Samples`

In the last few years, I have been mentoring under an experienced pharmaceutical sales rep (who currently works for ABC Co.), and studying pharmaceutical product lines across various therapeutic classes. Armed with this industry research and product foundation, I am confident that I would be a successful rep for XYZ Corporation.\n\nI also developed skills in the mortgage industry that are relevant to pharmaceutical sales. The loan process is highly consultative, and I demonstrated strengths in building positive relationships, offering excellent customer service and coaching clients throughout the process. Always focused on exceeding production goals, last year I: \n\n- Originated and closed $8.5 million in residential loans.\n- Held "Top Loan Originator" honors for the NY region.\n- Earned "Top Producer" ranking for GHI Loan Company, sourcing a partnership that enabled a new product offering.\n\nYou should know that I love selling, meeting new people and aggressively following up on all leads. I am also very comfortable using medical terminology and interacting with healthcare professionals. If you agree that I would make a positive addition to your team, please call me at home at (718) 555-5555 or on my cell at (917) 444-4444 to arrange an interview. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n\nAmanda Snow\n\nEnclosure: Resume`

I enjoyed our conversation, and I am very excited about the possibility of joining your team.\n\nI know what it takes to run a busy and successful insurance office. In my last position as an administrative assistant for XYZ Company, I helped manage all aspects of the operation, handling tasks such as bookkeeping, customer service, claims processing, report preparation and ongoing communications with the district manager.\n\nYou mentioned that you need an assistant who has strong “people” skills, and this is an area in which I excel. At XYZ Company, I helped the manager build a loyal client base by consistently providing excellent service. My last supervisor said, “John is one of the hardest-working employees I have known. His friendly and professional customer-service skills helped the firm achieve a 20 percent revenue increase last year, and I couldn’t have done it without him.”\n\nI don’t see the executive assistant role as a punch-the-clock, 9-to-5 job; I will be your “right hand”—helping you manage the day-to-day operations, volunteering for special projects, and ensuring the company is positioned for growth and increased profitability.\n\nAgain, thank you for considering me for this exciting opportunity.
